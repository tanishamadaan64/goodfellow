          <i
            >I donâ€™t know when it began, but I have always had a sense of
            affection toward the elderly. Over time, looking back at the friends
            I have, I notice a lot of silver-haired, gold-hearted people.
            Clearly, there has been something about their grounded, wise, and
            simple ways of looking at life that has brought me joy, and I notice
            the youth in their eyes as well when we are together.<br /><br />
            Intergenerational friendships are as special as any other bonds, if
            not more. But as I have gone through life and spoken to more people,
            I realize over 15 million elderlies in India live by themselves.
            While they may have found ways to fulfill their utility needs, they
            often lead isolated lives be it because of the loss of a companion
            or genuinely busy families. <br /><br />Today, by my side, stands a
            small but strong group of empathetic young graduates and
            professionals, who just like myself have found friends and love in
            elderlies in their own life, and now wish to bring the same bonds
            and friendship to many who seek it. After a successful beta test
            over several months full of learning, we have come to realize this
            is in fact the right way.<br /><br />
            We believe in this with full hearts, we believe in the love and
            comfort a bond between generations can bring, and we will continue
            to pursue it with all the empathy and sensitivity we can muster.<br /><br />
            With the trust and faith that our Grandpals and their families have
            put in us, I can say with great confidence: The Goodfellows are
            Coming!
